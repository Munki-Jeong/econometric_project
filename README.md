Replicate the econ paper "Do We Really Know That the WTO Increases Trade?".

## table1_econ140
The R script titled "table1_econ140.R" will run out of memory on Datahub's RStudio, so we highly recommend running on RStudio Desktop on your personal machine to get the desired results.
However, the lm1.4 model(table1_econ140.R) still does not work because of the same issue. 
To run this without the issue, a sufficiently large memory should be guaranteed.
